# Diffusion
## Project Description
This project aims to implement a u-net model to perform **diffusion**.<br>
Diffusion is carried out to **reconstruct images** by periodically adding noise to the image and training the u-net model to denoise it.<br>
The project was written in **Python 3.8, using anaconda**.
## Code
The code for this project can be found here,<br>
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-c3ntkIohUZFLdpvsH0VqLzNtJifrDrB?usp=sharing<br>
The project could not be uploaded to GitHub due to the **large file sizes**.
## Notes
The libraries required to run the project can be found in the **requirements.txt file** in the Diffusion folder.<br>
The command to install the required libraries can be found in the same file.
## Future Work
The work done on this project can be used further in the field of **deep anomaly detection** by reconstructing images. Images with high recontruction loss can be determined to be anomalous whereas images with low reconstruction loss can be determined to be non-anomalous.
